1.) Setup
```{r}
bank.data = bank_full
head(bank.data)
```

2.) Exploratory Data Analysis:
```{r}
summary(bank.data)

deposit.status = bank$y         

ggplot(bank.data,aes(x=bank.data$age,fill=deposit.status)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
  labs(y= "Number of Clients", x="Age", title = "Distribution of Deposits by Age")
ggplot(bank.data, aes(x=bank.data$job,fill=deposit.status)) + geom_bar(position = position_dodge())+
  labs(y= "Number of Clients", x="Job", title = "Distribution of Deposits by Job Type") #need to change aesthetic for x labels of factors#
ggplot(bank.data, aes(x=bank.data$marital,fill=deposit.status)) + geom_bar(position = position_dodge()) +
