# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Background
Here, we have a set of marketing data of a banking institution. The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Among the four datasets provided, we chose to utilize the "bank-full.csv" in this report, with 17 different inputs.

As mentioned in article (Lopez, Customer segmentation using machine learning 2020) [1], data science and machine learning methods are helpful when it comes to helping companies with customer segmentation. Customer targeting is the process of analyzing customer features to select those customers who are more prone to a target product or service. By making intelligent use of data, companies could make a big difference to their competitors. 

Advanced analytics plays a key role when it comes to selecting potentially profitable clients, which allows the design of more effective marketing campaigns. By using the four steps of advanced analytics: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive, we would be able to answer key questions such as "what happened?", "why did it happen?", "what will happen?", and "how can we make it happen?" 

In this report, we would be covering most of those steps. Our primary goal is to build a predictive model to answer a simple yes or no question: to determine whether a client will sign on to a long-term deposit. A model as such would allow banks to save on marketing expense on groups of customers that have a low chance of subscription, and focus on other customers that have a high chance of success. Overall, this would improve the profitability of banks and ultimately decrease marketing deficiencies.

While our main goal is to build a classification model and assist with bank marketing efforts, we would also like to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore relationships between different input variables. We would report any useful insights along the way, which covers both the "descriptive" and "diagnostic" parts of the four steps of advanced analytics as mentioned in the article.

## 1.2 Statistical Questions of Interest

To answer the primary scientific question of interest, we would fit our model in 2 different methods. The response will be a binary yes/no variable "has the client subscribed a term deposit?" All other variables provided will then be our input variables to allow us to build this model. Here, our 2  classification methods are

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest

We would then use both backward and forward stepwise model selection using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to conduct a heauristic model selection and prune down our model. We would also use AIC and BIC and compare the results of those with LRT. We would also use cross validation (CV) to obtain more robust results. Lastly we will choose between the two and select the better one using with better accuracy to be our final candidate.

# 2. Analysis Plan
We would first start by conducting an Exploratory Categorical Data Analysis (EDA) to evaluate the relationship between different variables. This would provide a descriptive story as to answering the most basic question like "what happened?" Then, we would start building our classification model using two methods.

## 2.1 Population and Study Design
The target population of this analysis would be all customers of banks in Portugal. We believe that sample from this particular Portuguese bank would be representative of all banks in Portugal. 

## 2.2 Statistical Analysis

```
A short summary of the Exploratory Data Analysis is as follows:

1.) Mean Age: 40.936
    Median Age: 39
    25th Percentile Age: 33
    75th Percentile Age: 48
    As we can see in the interactive plots when split by target is deselected, we can see that customers who are over the age of 60 are responsible for 33.6% of all deposits made followed by customers under the age of 30 at 18.5%

2.) Jobs: 
We can see a distribution of the types of jobs that dataset contains:
     admin.        = 5 171 (11.4%)
     blue-collar   = 9 732 (21.5%)
     entrepreneur  = 1 487 (3.3%)
     housemaid     = 1 240 (2.7%)
     management    = 9 458 (20.9%)
     retired       = 2 264 (5%)
     self-employed = 1 579 (3.5%)
     services      = 4 154 (9.2%)
     student       = 938 (2.1%)
     technician    = 7 597 (16.8%)
Most of the deposits are made by customers who work in management. Nearly 25% of customers who work as managers deposit money with the bank, followed by techinicians at around 17%.

3.) Marital Status:
Distribution of the martial status of customers is as follows:
     divorced = 5 207 (11.5%)
     married  = 27 214 (60.2%)
     single   = 12 790 (28.3%)
Married couples who deposit money in the bank account for 61.3% of deposits made, followed by 36.2% of single customers making deposits, followed by 11.8% of divorced customers make deposits. 

4.) Education: 
Summary statistics for educational distribution of the bank's customers are as follows:
     primary = 6 851 (15.2%)
     secondary = 23 202 (51.3%)
     tertiary  = 13 301 (29.4%)
     unknown   = 1 857 (4.1%)


5.) Defaults:
98.2% of customers do not default on credit payments. 11.8% of customers who do not default on payments make deposits as compared to 6.4% of customers who default on credit. 

5.) Balance:
Summary statistics of balance is as follows:
  Minimum balance: -8019
  Maximum balance: 102,127
  25th percentile balance: 72
  75th percentile balance: 1428
  median balance: 448
  mean: 1362
From the distribution plot we see that customers with a balance of 3000-6000 account for most customers who deposit money with the bank. 

6.) Housing Loan


### 2.2.2 Main Analysis
To answer our question of interest, building a predictive categorial model, we choose to utilize two different methods. 

1. Logistic regression, particularly using different stepwise methods (backward, forward, both) and different selection criteria (Likelihood-Ratio Test, AIC, BIC) to conduct variable selection for building the most effective model.

2. Random Forest

Finally, we will compare the two and see how the models compare to each other, and select a ultimate winner between the two. 


# 3. Extra-Credit Methods

## First Method: Stepwise (Forward, Backward, Both) Variable Selection using AIC, BIC, and Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) for our Logistic Regression Model. Specifically, we have computed results for: 

  1. LRT Forward - at 5% significance level, dropped variables *age*, *default*, *pdays*, *previous*, and *balance*.
  
  2. LRT Backward - same dropped variables as above.
  
  3. AIC Forward - dropped variables *previous*, *pdays*, *default*, *age*.
  
  4. AIC Backward - same dropped variables as above. 
  
  5. AIC Both
  
  6. BIC Forward
  
  7. BIC Backward
  
  8. BIC Both

```

Backward and forward stepwise using LRT yield same results. Dropped age, default, balance, pdays, previous

## Forward AIC - AIC give more complicated model, better predictive performance
```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
f_AIC <- step(glm(y~1, binomial, lr.bank.data),
     scope = ~age+job+marital+education+default+balance+housing+loan+contact+day+month+duration+campaign+pdays+previous+poutcome,
     direction = "forward")
#previous, pdays, default, age
# y ~ duration + poutcome + month + contact + housing + job + campaign + loan + marital + education + day + balance
```

## Forward BIC - simple - good for inference
```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
f_BIC <- step(glm(y~1, binomial, lr.bank.data),
     scope = ~age+job+marital+education+default+balance+housing+loan+contact+day+month+duration+campaign+pdays+previous+poutcome,
     direction = "forward",
     k = log(dim(lr.bank.data)[1]))
#education, balance, previous, default, age, pdays, job
#y ~ duration + poutcome + month + contact + housing + campaign + marital + loan + day
```

## Backward AIC - AIC give more complicated model, better predictive performance
```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
b_AIC <- step(glm(y~., binomial, lr.bank.data),
     direction = "backward")
#pdays, default, age, previous
# y ~ job + marital + education + balance + housing + loan + contact + day + month + duration + campaign + poutcome
```

## Backward BIC - simple - good for inference
```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
b_BIC <- step(glm(y~., binomial, lr.bank.data),
     direction = "backward",
     k = log(dim(lr.bank.data)[1]))
#education, balance, previous, default, age, pdays, job
#y ~ marital + housing + loan + contact + day + month + duration + campaign + poutcome
```

## bothward AIC
```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
both_AIC <- step(glm(y~1, binomial, lr.bank.data),
     scope = ~age+job+marital+education+default+balance+housing+loan+contact+day+month+duration+campaign+pdays+previous+poutcome,
     direction = "both")
#pdays, default, age, previous
#y ~ duration + poutcome + month + contact + housing + job + campaign + loan + marital + day + education + balance
```

## bothward BIC
```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
both_BIC <- step(glm(y~1, binomial, lr.bank.data),
     scope = ~age+job+marital+education+default+balance+housing+loan+contact+day+month+duration+campaign+pdays+previous+poutcome,
     direction = "both",
     k = log(dim(lr.bank.data)[1]))

#y ~ duration + poutcome + month + contact + housing + campaign + marital + loan + day
#education, balance, previous, default, age, pdays, job
```

For logistic regression, we use both forward and backward stepwise selection using AIC as our selection criteria. Although using the Liklihood Ratio Test(LRT) also works, we believe the using a proper parameter such as AIC or BIC would be more robust than using a LRT. Furthermore, we choose to use AIC over BIC. The reason is that we don't mind having a more comlicated model to give us better predictive performance, rather than having a small model as selected by the BIC (which is simple and better for inference as compared to a model selected by BIC.)

Ultimately, we see that all all 3 stepwise selections (backward, forward, both) using AIC yield the exact same model. We have dropped pdays, default, age, and previous. Our final logistic regression model would be

*y ~ duration + poutcome + month + contact + housing + job + campaign + loan + marital + day + education + balance*

## Confusion matrix
```{r}
#Build logistic model with selected significant variables using AIC stepwise variable selection
logistic.model.AIC <- glm(y ~ duration + poutcome + month + contact + housing + job + campaign + loan + marital + day + education + balance, binomial(link = "logit"),lr.bank.data)

pred = format(round(predict(logistic.model.AIC, newdata = bank.test, type = "response")))
conf = table(pred, as.factor(bank.test$y))
#Classification accuracy
(conf[1,1]+conf[2,2])/(sum(conf))
```
## Animay

```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Tuning parameters
pred.tune.log = prediction(logistic.pred, bank.test$y)
perf.tune.log = performance(pred.tune.log, measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
accuracy.log = performance(pred.tune.log, measure = "acc", x.measure = "cutoff")
plot(accuracy.log)
plot(perf.tune.log) ##selecting cut off calue of 0.3


pred.cutoff = cut(logistic.pred, c(-Inf, 0.2, Inf), labels = c("No","Yes"))
 
##Confusion
glmconf = table(pred.cutoff, bank.test$y)
summary(pred.cutoff)
acc.logistic = (glmconf[1,1]+glmconf[2,2])/(sum(glmconf))
```
-Accuracy = TP+TN/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
Thus accuracy = `r acc.logistic`

The above correlogram is ordered in a first principle component manner. We can see that for the response variable, i.e. Y, the following can be said for its correlation with respect to the predictor variables:
1.) 

# Random Forest
a.	Random Forest is a collection of decision trees and average/majority vote of the forest is selected as the predicted output.
b.	Random Forest model will be less prone to overfitting than Decision tree, and gives a more generalized solution.
c.	Random Forest is more robust and accurate than decision trees.

i.	Deduct the importance of variables (higher incnodepurity & incMSE more importance)
ii.	Choose sqrt(p) predictors
iii.	Use mtry from 1 to p and then use CV

```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#create random forest model with all variables, mtry = sqrt(p) for classification
rf <- randomForest(as.factor(y)~ ., data = bank.train, importance = TRUE, mtry = sqrt(dim(bank.train)[2]-1), ntree = 300)
#importance of variables
importance(rf)
#plot of importance of variables
varImpPlot(rf)

#duration is the most important variable, default is the least important

test.err = double(16)                      #Test error
for(mtry in 1:16){
  fit = randomForest(as.factor(y)~., data = bank.train, mtry=mtry, ntree = 1)
  oob.err[mtry] = fit$err.rate[1]
  pred = predict(fit, boston[-train,])
  test.err[mtry] = with(boston[-train,], mean( (medv-pred)^2 ))

prediction_rf <- format(predict(rf, bank.test))
conf_rf <- table(prediction_rf, as.factor(bank.test$y))
conf_rf

#Classification accuracy
classicitation_accuracy_rf <- (conf_rf[1,1]+conf_rf[2,2])/(sum(conf_rf))
```
Classification accuracy is `r classicitation_accuracy_rf`, very close to what we get in our logistic model after AIC variable selection.
